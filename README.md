<h1> Tic Tac Toe </h1>
<p>This is my first attempt at building a website, in which, I created a Tic-Tac-Toe game which has multiple options regarding  the choice of single-player/multi-player game, as well as, which shape to choose i.e. X or O. I've also added the option of who will move first in a single player game:- the player or the computer. <p>
<br>
<p>For the single player game, the computer is unbeatable, as I used the minimax algorithm(used to solve zero sum games with considerably less states) to solve the problem of choosing the optimal move.<p>
